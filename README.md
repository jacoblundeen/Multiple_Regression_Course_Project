# Multiple_Regression_Course_Project
Repository for Multiple Regression Course Project

This repository is for the Coursera Multiple Regression Course Project. This project uses the "mtcars" data set and asks the student to show the relationship between miles per gallon and transmission type using multiple regression.

When viewing the .Rmd file, you will notice multiple blocks of code that are commented out and not present in the final report. This was done to cut the report down to the required five page maximum.
